### Java Basics
<details>
  <summary>What is JDK?</summary>
 Java development kit used for developing business logics, web services etc... which intern will have inbuilt toolkit or compiler like creating Java schema from XML file and much more. JDK comes with JRE.
</details> 
<details>
  <summary>What is JRE?</summary>
  Java Runtime Environment which executes the .class files or compiled code generated by JDK. JRE will be used on production servers where Java application is deployed.
</details> 
<details>
  <summary>What is JVM?</summary>
  Java Virtual Machine which act as a special VM for running Java application and it’s OS independent can run on any platform “code once and run everywhere “ JVM has options to set heap memory. Can be visualised using tools. Multiple Java application cannot share one JVM.

  <summary>What is Garbase Collector?</summary>
  Java internally takes care of unused declaration of hanging object declaration. So it’s called as robust programming language. It will have time check for each variable declarations to clear the garbage frequently/periodically. JDK allows to change the garbage collector algorithms. The heap memory will be cleared by performing garbage action. Global declarations with Singleton scope cannot be cleared by garbage collector. So setting the global declaration to null will help the application to be safe with memory management.

<details>
  <summary>What are different type of JDK's?</summary>
oracle Java, open jdk, IBM jdk which will have different garbage collector algorithms implementation for performance optimisation and improvement.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is JSR ?</summary>
 JSR committee - to maintain the implementation across different jdk Java Specification Request has been formed.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is ORACLE Java License?</summary> 
  ORACLE JAVA Licensing from 11 version so other committees formed the repo and started enhancing the feature as per JSR
</details>
<details>
  <summary>General Topic</summary> 
  Most of the hacking will be done on c or c++ since it has low level apis to read memory information. Security is the concern here so most of the production system will be with dedicated hosting.

  <summary>What is JAR?</summary> 
  JAR stands for Java Archive. It is an archiving format which contains .class files with META-INF folder and manifest.mf file.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is WAR?</summary> 
  WAR stands for Web Archive. It is an archiving format which contains .class files, META-INF folder and manifest.mf file, WEB-INF folder with web.xml contains servlets path, JSPs and HTML/CSS/IMAGES.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is EAR?</summary> 
  EAR stands for Enterprise Archive. It is an archiving format which contains .class files, META-INF folder and manifest.mf file, WEB-INF folder with web.xml contains servlets path, HTML/CSS/IMAGES, EJB beans.

  <summary>What is Java Class loader?</summary>
